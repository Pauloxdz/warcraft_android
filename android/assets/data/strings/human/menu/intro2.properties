description=The mysterious Elves of Silvermoon have sent a contingent of Archers south to survey the supposed Orcish threat for themselves.\n\nOur spies report that shortly after passing through the Alterac grasslands the Elves were ambushed by Horde troops.\n\nIt is believed that these Elves are now being held in a small prison camp near the northwest region of Tarren Mill.\n\nLord Terenas, fervently hoping to enlist the Elves into the Alliance, has asked that you search for the missing warriors and deliver them to safety.\n\nThe Elves have sent a cadre of Archers to assist in your quest.  You will also be provided with plans to construct an Elven Lumber Mill and the sylvan craftsman to operate it.
